I am a Master student at ShanghaiTech, advised by Prof. Shenghua Gao. I received my undergraduate degree from Xiamen University. I have also spent time at research lab of Tencent AI Lab.

My research focuses on Computer Vision and Machine Learning, espically on 3D Vision (Depth Estimation, Plane Detection, Multi-view Stereo, 3D reconstruction, 3D Human Modeling).

My CV is [here](http://niujinshuchong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
